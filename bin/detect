# The 'detect' script is executed by the slug compiler with one argument:
#   1. build_dir: location of your app directory on the build dyno
#
# If 'detect' exits with status code 0:
#   stdout is inserted in "-----> <X> app detected" and 'compile' script is run
# If 'detect' exits with status code != 0:
#   the buildpack is not used
